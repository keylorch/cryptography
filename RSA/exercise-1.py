# Question #1
# Consider the following situation.
# You have obtained the following information from a password distribution centre that
# has just sent out a password in the form of a number made up of eight two digit ASCII 
# representation of uppercase letters. 
# The password was sent to three recipients
# Each recipient is using unpadded RSA with public key values of 3 but different n values
# The three (ciphertext, n) pairs are,
# (1338853906351615603845328037909, 4963703553974661181865803149931)
# (742171294423584777417515756208, 2112487534646562115950045691561)
# (1364412949550017047575133658763, 3655661175938877172141578380053)
# Recover the password without factoring any of the n values.

# Solution
# This exercise represents the problem where a small group of clients are sharing
# the same small public key but different n values, and they are transmitting the same 
# message (the password)
